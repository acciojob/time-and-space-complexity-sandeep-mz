    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
      Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures
      the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete
      as a function of the input size now lets understands what is Space complexity. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space
      an algorithm uses to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It
      is crucial to manage space effectively, especially in memory-constrained
      environments. When analyzing algorithms,
      we often use the Big O notation to express both time and space complexity.
      For instance, an algorithm with <b>Space Complexity O(n)</b> implies that
      the amount of memory it uses increases linearly with the input size.
