	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete as a function of the input size. In other words, it quantifies the amount of time an algorithm needs to run relative to the size of the input data. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, ensuring faster execution even for large inputs.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses to solve a problem as a function of the input size. It is crucial to manage space effectively, especially in memory-constrained environments. Algorithms with lower space complexity optimize memory usage, leading to better resource utilization.</p>
    <p>When analyzing algorithms, we often use the Big O notation to express both time and space complexity. For instance, an algorithm with <b>Space Complexity O(n)</b> implies that the amount of memory it uses increases linearly with the input size.</p>
